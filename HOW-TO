The Contents of the disk including this file are Assign1-Personal_Firewall.sh, 
monitor.sh, Assign1-Design-Document.docx and Assign1-Testing-Document.docx

In order to set up the firewall, you simple need to give the executable 
permissions to the Assign1-Personal_Firewall.sh, see the example below
chmod +x Assign1-Personal_Firewall.sh

Before you run the firewall script make sure monitor.sh script is in the
same location as the firewall script
and then just run the script as shown below
./Assign1-Personal_Firewall.sh

Once the firewall rules are deployed, the script will fire monitor.sh 
script and it will begin showing live updates of iptables data.

The monitor.sh script can be turned off by pressing CTRL + C.
